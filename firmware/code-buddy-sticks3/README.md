# Code Buddy Firmware

This firmware targets the M5Stack StickS3 and turns it into a Code Buddy approval device for Codex CLI.

> Building your own hardware client instead? See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the BLE protocol and JSON payloads.

## User Flashing Path

1. Download `code-buddy-sticks3-v{version}-full.bin` from GitHub Releases.
2. Flash that merged image onto the StickS3 at address `0x0`.

Primary path:

- If this release publishes a web flasher page, use it.

Fallback path:

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --baud 460800 write_flash 0x0 code-buddy-sticks3-v0.1.2-full.bin
```

After flashing, go back to the Mac and run:

```bash
code-buddy
```

That will request Bluetooth permission, pair the StickS3, sync time, and finish the Mac-side setup.

## Developer Build Path

Build and flash directly with PlatformIO:

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

If you need a clean reflash:

```bash
pio run -t erase && pio run -t upload
```

Build the merged GitHub Release artifact:

```bash
../scripts/build-firmware-release.sh
```

| **Face-down**           | nap (energy refills) |             |             |             |

The screen auto-powers off after 30 seconds of inactivity and stays on while an approval is pending.

## GIF Characters

If you want a custom GIF character instead of the ASCII buddy, push a character pack folder over the buddy transfer path. The bridge streams it over BLE and the stick switches to GIF mode live. `Settings -> delete char` returns to ASCII mode.

Character packs need a `manifest.json` plus 96px-wide GIFs. See `characters/bufo/` for a working example.
